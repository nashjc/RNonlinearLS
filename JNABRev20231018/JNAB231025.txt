I think I've used all your suggestions. Much appreciated. Made a (very) few minor punctuation 
and wording changes. The zip file seems to have everything to build the paper in RJournal
style with the response doc. Tried to leave out anything not needed to avoid confusion.

I've added apa.csl file to get the "p." in the citation to Hobbs problem.

Attached is the zip and an edited (Xournal) pdf which adds notes to your comments.

Note that I've dated zip Friday. I'll submit then unless I hear from you. However, I
think we are "there" now.

Best, 

JN
